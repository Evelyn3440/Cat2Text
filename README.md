# Cat2Text
Translates cat meows in a sort of base 4 into english with really bad code!
# Format
This requires all of your data to add up to the letter number in the english language ex. a = 1, z = 26. The data is practically in base 4 where meow = 0 mrrp = 1 mreow = 2 and mrow = 3, you do need leading 0's btw.

An example would be ```Meow mreow mrrp; meow mrow meow meow mrow mrow mrrp mrrp mreow meow mrrp mrrp; meow meow mrow meow meow mrrp mrrp mrrp meow mrrp meow mrow```.
Which converts to "i love cats"

More could be added on later but for now this is all.
